## About

This package will take pdf snapshots of rendered web pages in bulk using Puppeteer (aka headless Chromium).

## Why?

Using the chrome cli over many URLs is way CPU expensive and slow, because you must open a new browser per URL. This app opens and re-uses a single browser instance, thereby limiting to a single CPU AND with less CPU effort.


## Caveats

1. Takes about 2 seconds per snapshot per screen
1. Not quite pixel perfect.


## Requirements

1. Requires Node v7.x or higher

## Installation

```
yarn global add chrome-bulk-screenshot
or
npm install -g chrome-bulk-screenshot
```

## Usage

```
chrome-bulk-screenshot [options]

Options
  --rainbow, -r  Include a rainbow
  --init, -i  Copy demo config here

Examples
  $ chrome-bulk-screenshot --init
  ðŸŒˆ unicorns ðŸŒˆ
  $ chrome-bulk-screenshot --config=config.yml
  ...
```

Then check the 'out' folders.
